# Fixed-Point-Arrey-Example
> A function that finds the fixed point of an array (Using Java)

This current function gets a sorted array (arr) containing different integers. 

The function returns an index in array i, which holds arr[i] = i. <br />
If there is no value as required the function returns 1-.

For example, for the following array: 
[61, 22, 12, 9,	4,	2,	1,	-1,	-7] <br />
The function must return 4. <br />

For demonstration, I created in the main routine three arrays in sizes 20, 30 and 40, with two of them having a fixed point and a third not, and I printed appropriate messages.
